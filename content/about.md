Hey! I’m Nuno Maduro—a [speaker](/talks), [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro), [streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/enunomaduro), [Laravel core team member](https://laravel.com), and [open-source developer](https://github.com/nunomaduro).

I’ve created and maintain several popular open-source projects, including [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), [Collision](https://github.com/nunomaduro/collision), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [PHP Insights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights), [Termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind), [OpenAI for PHP](https://github.com/openai-php/client), [PEST](https://pestphp.com/), [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/), [Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint), [Pail](https://github.com/laravel/pail), and [Volt](https://github.com/livewire/volt). These projects have been downloaded over **500 million times**, helping developers worldwide build better software faster.

I have a close relationship with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) community, the most popular PHP framework in the world. As a core team member, I’ve developed and maintained multiple Laravel projects and features that are used by companies like The New York Times, Disney, Twitch, and more.

As a [speaker](/talks), I’ve delivered talks in dozens of countries at major conferences, including Laracon US, Laracon India, Laracon EU, PHP Italy, Forum PHP, PHP Serbia, and more. My conference talks typically focus on the open-source tools I’ve built, PHP, and Laravel, often featuring live coding sessions.

I’m also actively involved in organizing meetups. For example, I’ve organized events like [Laravel France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMYhsfR1kNI) and created the [PHP Portugal](https://php-portugal.com) meetup.

Currently, I’m working on [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com) while maintaining and contributing to the projects I’ve developed over the years.
