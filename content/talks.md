## Writing Effective PHP

PHP has evolved massively since its first days, and it's on the road to a full-featured language. However, at the same time, there is a lot of outdated information and libraries with poorly written code.

This talk is about writing PHP Code that is: safe, robust, and maintainable. We are going to cover a set of rules, that if you follow them; they will get you on the habit of writing code well.

## Illuminate Console Applications with Laravel Zero

While it's fun to write little one-off utility scripts, sometimes you need to write real console apps. One that takes arguments and plays nicely with UNIX conventions for input, output or error reporting.

In this talk, we will be using Laravel Zero, a micro-framework that leverages an unofficial and customized version of Laravel to provide an elegant starting point for your console app.
