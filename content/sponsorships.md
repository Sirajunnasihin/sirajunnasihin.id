**Want your logo featured in front of thousands of developers on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/enunomaduro) every single day? Check below for YouTube and Twitch sponsorship opportunities.**

## Open-Source Contributions

I am the creator and maintainer of several popular open-source projects, including [PEST](https://pestphp.com/), [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), [Collision](https://github.com/nunomaduro/collision), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), [PHP Insights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights), [Termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind), [OpenAI for PHP](https://github.com/openai-php/client), [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/), [Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint), [Pail](https://github.com/laravel/pail), and [Volt](https://github.com/livewire/volt). These projects have been downloaded over 500 million times, helping developers worldwide build better software faster.

Maintaining these projects requires significant time and effort. With community support, I can continue improving existing tools and creating new projects to make PHP development more efficient and enjoyable.

## YouTube and Twitch

I regularly share knowledge on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro) (8k+ subscribers) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/enunomaduro) (1k+ followers), engaging with over 56k developers on Twitter. I stream almost daily at 9 PM UTC and publish new videos every day at 1 PM UTC.

If you’d like to support me as an individual, you can:

- Become a YouTube Member: [youtube.com/nunomaduro/join](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro/join)
- Subscribe on Twitch: [twitch.tv/subs/enunomaduro](https://www.twitch.tv/subs/enunomaduro)
- Donate via PayPal: [paypal.com/paypalme/enunomaduro](https://paypal.com/paypalme/enunomaduro)

For businesses, this is an excellent opportunity to showcase your logo to a highly engaged audience of developers. The process is simple and this is what you receive:

1. **Dedicated Video**
   - During the six-month sponsorship period, I will create one video, from a live stream, post it on my YouTube channel, showcasing an unbiased usage of your product in a real-world development stack.
   - The video will focus on the product's benefits and its use cases for developers.

2. **Logo Placement on Live Streams**
   - Your company logo will appear on every live stream I host during the sponsorship period.
   - Logos may rotate (fade in/out) with other sponsors’ logos.

3. **Prominent Link in Video Descriptions**
   - All videos created after December 1, 2024, will have a link to your product or company in the description.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Reach Out

To express interest, email me at [enunomaduro@gmail.com](mailto:enunomaduro@gmail.com) with the following details:

- Company Name
- Logo (high-resolution)
- Website URL
- Brief Description of Your Company/Product
- I reserve the right to decline sponsorships if the product does not align with my content or audience.

I will respond with a decision on whether I accept the sponsorship, along with the pricing, conditions, and bank account details for the transfer.

#### Step 2: Payment and Commitment

- Sponsorship requires an upfront payment for six months.
- Payments are final and non-refundable, regardless of circumstances.

**Renewals:**
- Between the first and fifth month of the sponsorship period, I may adjust pricing or decide not to renew for the following term.
- Renewals must be completed in the month prior to the current term ending.

**Invoices:**
- If an invoice is required, please request it via email.
- Invoices will be provided in Portuguese.

For inquiries or to begin the sponsorship process, **email me at [enunomaduro@gmail.com](mailto:enunomaduro@gmail.com)**. Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to working with you.
