- **Individuals**: [github.com/sponsors/nunomaduro](https://github.com/sponsors/nunomaduro), [youtube.com/nunomaduro/join](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro/join), [twitch.tv/subs/enunomaduro](https://www.twitch.tv/subs/enunomaduro), or [paypal.com/paypalme/enunomaduro](https://paypal.com/paypalme/enunomaduro).
- **Businesses**: Want your business logo featured in front of thousands of developers on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/enunomaduro) every single day? Check below for YouTube and Twitch sponsorship opportunities.

I regularly share knowledge on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro) (9k+ subscribers) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/enunomaduro) (1.2k+ followers), engaging with over 57k developers on Twitter. I stream at last 5 times per week at 9 PM UTC and publish new videos almost every day at 1 PM UTC.

This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your business logo to a highly engaged audience of developers. The process is simple and this is what you receive:

- All YouTube videos created after December 1, 2024, will have a link to your product or company in the description, during the sponsorship period.
- Your company logo will appear on every live stream and video I host during the sponsorship period. (Logos may rotate (fade in/out) with other sponsors’ logos)

#### How It Works? Step 1: Reach Out

To express interest, email me at [enunomaduro@gmail.com](mailto:enunomaduro@gmail.com) with the following details: Company Name, Logo (high-resolution), Website URL, Brief Description of Your Company/Product

I reserve the right to decline sponsorships if the product does not align with my content or audience. Also, I will respond with a decision on whether I accept the sponsorship, along with the pricing, conditions, and bank account details for the transfer.

#### Step 2: Payment and Commitment

- Sponsorship requires an upfront payment for six months.
- Payments are final and non-refundable, regardless of circumstances.
- If an invoice is required, please request it via email.

**Renewals:**
- Between the first and fifth month of the sponsorship period, I may adjust pricing or decide not to renew for the following term.
- Renewals must be completed in the month prior to the current term ending.

For inquiries or to begin the sponsorship process, **email me at [enunomaduro@gmail.com](mailto:enunomaduro@gmail.com)**. Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to working with you.
